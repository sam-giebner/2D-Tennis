# 2D-Tennis
## Overview
2D-Tennis is a two player print and play board game that captures the thrill, skill, suspense of a tennis match on a sheet of paper.

## Materials
- (1) 2D-Tennis court
- (2) Pennies (Players)
- (1) Dime (Tennis ball)
## Setup
1. Distribute a penny to each player.
2. Flip a coin to determine which player will serve first.
3. The coin toss winner flips their penny to "heads" and the loser to "tails" for the duration of the match.
## Order of Play
### 1. Position Players
1. Place both the serving player and the ball behind the baseline on the right or left side of the court.
2. Place the returning player anywhere on the returning side of the court in the half kiddy corn the serving player and ball.
### 2. Serve
1. The serving player flicks the ball across the net to the returning side of the court. 
    - A legal serve must:
        - Land inbounds (Entirely on the court OR touch the base/sidelines).
        - Land in the half of the court kiddy corner the serving player.
        - Must not touch the net on the first serve.
            - A ball that is atleast half way over the net on secound serve is played as a "let" serve.
2. The serving player penny is flicked into position on the serving side of the court.
    - If the serving player penny is more that half way over the net, the point has been won by the other player.
### 3. Return
1. The returning player attempts to "hit" the ball by flicking their penny so that it makes contact with the ball.
    - The point is won by the other player if:
        - The returning player penny fails to contact the ball.
        - The returning player penny goes more that halfway over the net.
    - A player whose penny has been struck by a serve or return has successfully "hit" the ball.
        - If a player's penny has been struck by the ball and sent off the paper, the penny is immediatly placed anywhere on the baseline.
2. The returning player places their shot by by flicking the ball back over the net to the other side of the court.
    - If the ball more than halfway or completly over the net as a result of the "hit", the ball has been returned and the shot has already been placed.
    - The point is won by the other player if:
        - The ball does not land inbounds (Entirely on the court OR touches the base/sidelines).
